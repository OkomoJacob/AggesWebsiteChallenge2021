<!-- AGGES website challenge 

Points to note:
       Am a beginner when i comes to developing complete projects like this.
       There are also issues which may need fixing.
       Most importantly  blog content and main site content are separate and am trying to figure out how to merge them to single repository. This happened as initially i started working using bootstrap and later switched to jerky. This imply that blog repository will be fork from my github repo
-->

##  Blog and Resource content

To access the blog content, **fork**[Agges-Blog](https://github.com/alfredamboka/Agges-Blog) and access the program resources.

Additional resources for events planning am proposing in adding to this section so that it can be updated using markdow prier the events day. This should outline the events resources with proper link to cloud storage where one can download the shareable resources for practice.

## Design and  responsiveness

I have tried as much to make this website responsive on all screens using <style = "color: darkblue">[*bootstrap technologies*]</style>(https://bit.ly/3pU0j2u).

### Things left out 

+ On home page: Interactive map have been left out and therefore may be added later. I left out as am still searching on how to incorporate full functional map content in website.
+ Several back end  features for  user registration and uploading files to our site for others to use are note yet implemented. I have just done the front end part to test if its necessary or not.

This sections are on following pages
+ Membership registration page
+ Project page ; that allow user to upload project proposal file for club to handle
+ Past papers page; students can upload papers and admin reviews them before publishing on the site
+ Afew automation for notifying members on upcoming weekly events. <span style = "color: orange">on events page</span>.
+ Social media links and contact links have been left and will be added once this mock site is approved.
  
## Useful accounts

I have created two accounts to manage comments and google analytics.

The email address i created will be provided on request which manages this resources.
